    VERSION INFO
    ------------
    0.1.1:
        2021-10-06
        Replacing print by parprint.    
    
    0.1.0: 
        2021-09-06 
        Initial release.

    DESCRIPTION
    -----------
    SAFIRES is a partitioning scheme designed to divide a simulation
    supercell into two regions to be calculated separately, using
    different (or the same) computational methodologies.

    SAFIRES assumes that three necessary components are present
    in a simulation: 1) the solute, which can be a particle / molecule
    or a periodic surface; 2) an inner region close to the solute;
    3) an outer region separated from the solute by the inner region.
    SAFIRES assumes the same fundamental premise as FIRES does
    (Rowley and Roux, JCTC, 2012) by requiring that all particles in
    the inner and outer region are the same (the solute can be
    different). If particles are indistinguishable, it can be shown
    that correct average ensemble properties can be obtained despite
    the presence of the bounadary.
    The position of the boundary is flexible with respect to the
    inner region particle that is furthest away from the solute.
    If a boundary event is detected, SAFIRES will redirect the
    involved inner and outer region particles by performing an
    elastic collision between them, using the boundary as a mediator
    for the collision. SAFIRES can scale the time step of the
    simulation to match the exact moment that a collision occurs.
    SAFIRES uses a new propagator to handle these dynamic time steps.
    This propagator reduces to the Vanden-Eijnden / Cicotti
    implementation of the Langevin propagator for a constant time
    step and to the Velocity Verlet propagator for a constant time
    step and zero friction.

    "particle": any atom or molecule involved in SAFIRES.
    "solute"/"center": referring the atoms in the solute
                       or periodic surface (atom.tag = 0).
    "inner"/"INNER": referring to particles in the inner
                     region (atom.tag = 1).
    "outer"/"OUTER": referring to particles in the outer
                     region (atom.tag = 2).
    "boundary": the boundary sphere (atomic or molecular
                solute) or boundary plane (surface as
                solute) that separates inner and outer
                region. sphere radius or plane distance,
                respectively, are defined by the distance
                of the INNER particle furthest away from
                the solute / periodic surface.
    "boundary event": if any OUTER particles are detected
                      closer to the solute than the INNER
                      particle currently furthest away from
                      the solute / periodic surface.

    USAGE:
    ------
   1) atoms = Atoms([...])
       atom.tag = 0 --> solute molecule or periodic surface
       atom.tag = 1 --> inner region
       atom.tag = 2 --> outer region

    2) md = MD([...])
        where MD = Langevin or VelocityVerlet

    3) safires = SAFIRES(atoms=atoms,
                         mdobject=md,
                         natoms=int number of atoms in each
                                molecule e.g. 3 for water,
                         logfile=str custom SAFIRE logfile name,
                         debug=True/False,

                         surface=True/False,
                         reflective=True/False)

    4) md.attach(safires.safires, interval=1)

    5) md.run([...])


    TODO:
    -----
    - currently fix_com is required to be False for Langevin.
      that shouldn't be the case.

        KEYWORD ARGUMENTS:
        ------------------
        atoms -- ASE atoms object
        mdobject -- ASE molecular dynamics object
        natoms -- number of atoms in each molecule in the simulation
                  (excluding the solute, which can be different)
        logfile -- custom str name for logfile
        debug -- enable/disable debug mode (default: False)
        barometer -- enable/disable barometer (default: False)
        surface -- treat solute as periodic surface (default: False)

        NAMESPACE DOCUMENTATION
        -----------------------
        self.atoms --
            atoms object passed to SAFIRES in the input script.

        self.surface --
            if True, then the solute (atom.tag = 0) is considered
            a surface. this changes / simplifies a lot of the math
            since only the z direction needs to be accounted for.
            important limitation: surface must be perpendicular to
            z axis, no oblique or stepped surfaces possible.

        self.constraints --
            some SAFIRES procedures require that all constraints
            (notably: RATTLE) are momentarily removed from the
            atoms object. they are copied here and reapplied
            at the end of the procedure.

        self.natoms --
            int number of atoms in each molecule that make up the
            inner and outer region. SAFIRES requires that all
            inner and outer region particles are indistinguishable
            as the main premise (see publication).
        
        self.reflective --
            switches to an implementation of SAFIRES that performs
            reflections at the boundary (no momentum exchange!)
            instead of performing an elastic collision between the
            conflicting inner/outer region particle pair.

        self.previous_atoms --
            copy of the atoms object from previous iterations
            used to get back to a conflict free state when a
            boundary event occurs. initialized simply as a copy
            of the initial atoms object. this means that if a
            boundary event occurs during step 0, there is no viable
            configuration to go back to to resolve the conflict
            and SAFIRES will crash.

        self.previous_atoms.calc --
            the previous_atoms object requires a placeholder
            calculator to store some of the required properties
            we need to pass to it.

        self.mdobject --
            molecular dynamics object passed to SAFIRES in the
            input script.

        self.default_dt --
            default time step defined in the input script.

        self.remaining_dt --
            counting variable used to keep track of the time
            required to complete a full default_dt when SAFIRES
            performes fractional time steps during a boundary event.

        self.previous_boundary_idx --
            keeps track of which particle (by index) defined the
            flexible boundary in the previous iteration.
            necessary because SAFIRES resets to the previous
            iteration when a boundary event occurs. initializes
            to zero, updates with a useful value after first
            successful MD iteration without boundary event.

        self.tocollide --
            keeps track of which pair of INNER/OUTER particles
            are tagged for separation through collision during
            a boundary event.

        self.recent --
            keeps track of which pair of INNER/OUTER particles
            underwent separation by collision in the current
            iteration. this is necessary so that SAFIRES doesn't
            treat the same particles over and over if multiple
            boundary events occur during the same time step.

        self.logfile --
            name of  the logfile for SAFIRES specific results..
            SAFIRES logs additional specific information such
            as the location of the boundary sphere relativ to
            the solute at each iteration, and the number of
            collisions. Set to None to suppress output.
            Default: "safires.log".

        self.ncollisions --
            tracks total number of boundary events and subsequent
            collisions that have taken place over the simulation
            time.

        self.ndoubles --
            specifically tracks the number of times that more
            than one collision has occurred during the same
            time step of length self.default_dt.

        self.barometer --
            if True, this will count how many boundary events are
            caused by inner or outer particles, respectively.
            this can reveal if there's an artificial pressure in
            the system (these numbers shouldn't deviate
            dramatically).

        self.impacts --
            counter for self.barometer.

        self.debug --
            if True, verbose output is written to 'debug.log'
            during each iteration. False by default because it
            creates overhead that's usually unnessecary.

        """Propagate the simulation.

        Keyword arguments:
        dt -- the time step used to propagate.
        checkup -- True/False, is used internally to indicate if
                   this is a checkup run which occurs after a
                   successful boundary event resolution. this is done
                   to catch rare cases where a second outer region
                   particle has entered the inner region during the
                   resolution of a first boundary event.
        halfstep -- 1/2, indicates if we're propagating so that the
                    conflicting inner and outer particle are at the
                    same distance from the center using the
                    extrapolated time step from extrapolate_dt()
                    to perform a collision (halfstep = 1) or if the
                    collision is already performed and we're
                    propagating to make up the remaining time to
                    complete a full default time step (halfstep = 2).

        This propagation algorithm is based on the Vanden-Eijnden /
        Cicotti implementation of the Langevin algorithm. It has been
        modified to perform the propagation in two halfsteps. It is
        used during the SAFIRES procedure in-lieu of the superordinate
        MD algorithm specified in the user input to fulfill the
        specific requirements of this approach, as outlined below.

        The first halfstep uses a fraction of the original, default
        time step as obtained from extrapolate_dt(). However, the
        velocities are updated based on forces and Langevin random
        components as if the original, default time step would be
        performed. After the end of this first halfstep, the
        atoms have been propagated so that the conflicting pair of
        inner and outer region particles are located at the same
        distance from the solute. From this obtained arrangement
        we can perform an exact elastic collision between them.

        The second halfstep used a time step that is
        (initial time step - time step used in halfstep 1).
        During this halfstep, the velocities are NOT updated as
        they were already updated during halfstep 1 based on
        the forces and Langevin random components scaled by
        the regular, default time step.

        Note that the Langevin random components are not randomized
        between halfsteps or between the time step extrapolation in
        extrapolate_dt() and the propagation since we require the
        atoms to behave deterministically while SAFIRES operates.

        The checkup switch will make it so that velocities
        are not updated in the first halfstep. Checkup is True is
        called after a boundary event has been successfully resolved,
        which means that propagate() was already run and the
        velocities were already updated based on the full default
        time step. If a subsequent boundary event needs to be
        resolved right after the resolution of a first event
        (without the regular MD being called in between, i.e.
        multiple events during the same default time step),
        the propagation during this second resolution occurs
        without any velocity updates. Otherwise we would apply the
        forces and random components multiple times during the same
        time step and thus destroy energy conservation.

        Finally, after the first and any subsequent boundary events
        have been resolved completely and the simulation has been
        propagated by a complete default time step, the second
        velocity halfstep required by Langevin is performed. After
        this, SAFIRES returns control over the simulation back to
        the superordinate MD algorithm defined  n the user input.
        Technically, the second velocity halfstep is performed after
        the initial, checkup is False cycle but is then undone if
        subsequent boundary events are detected during the
        checkup = True cycle. This ensures that the second velocity
        halfstep is performed on the absolute final atomic
        configuration obtained by SAFIRES before returning control
        over the situation to superordinate MD propagator.

           away from the COM of the solute and the outer region
           particle that is closest to the COM of the solute are
           exactly the same distance from the solute

        2) reset the atoms object to the last state before the event.
        3) propagate by this extrapolated time step using and internal
           modified propagator --> propagate().
        4) perform elastic collision between the conflicting pair of
           inner and outer region particles to redirect them.
        5) propagate the system by the remaining time step needed to
           complete a full default time step -->  propagate().
        6) re-run safires() to check if another boundary event
           occurred as result of the propagation in step 5).
        7a) another boundary event is detected: return to step 1) but
            reset to the configuration obtained after step 3) so as to
            not undo the previous boundary event resolution.
        7b) no additional boundary event detected: return control over
