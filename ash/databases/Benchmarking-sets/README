Each directory in here is a separate benchmarking database for molecular reactions.
Each directory, e.g. IE-benzenes should contain a README file and a directory called data.
The README file should contain human-readable basic information about the dataset.
The data directory should contain XYZ-files for the dataset and a file: "Reference_data.txt" that contains definitions about the reactions.

Example:

"IE-benzenes" data-set:
    => README
    => data
        => benzene-neut.xyz
        => benzene-ox.xyz
        => etc.
        => Reference_data.txt
        => corrections.txt (optional file)

#IMPORTANT: Each XYZ-file should contain the charge and multiplicity in the title-line (2nd header-line of XYZ file format)


The Reference_data.txt contains information about the reactions in the following format
- The #TESTSET_INFO lines contain information on the number of reactions and the unit for the reference data.
  These special lines are read and parsed by ASH.
- Other # lines are convenient comment-lines but are not read by ASH.
- Each numbered line defines a reaction. The ASCII-string words in the line point to XYZ-files in the same dir
  while the integers indicate the stoichiometry of the reaction (negative number: reactant, positive number: product).
  The last floating point number is always the reference value (e.g. experimental value) in the unit indicated in the #TESTSET_INFO line. 

#IMPORTANT: species/file-names have to contain an alphabetic character (not only integer)
#IMPORTANT: The reference value has to be a floating point, not an integer (add .0 to number)

If the corrections.txt file is present inside data dir (this is optional) then the additive corrections per reactions will be read.
This correction can e.g. be ZPE, total enthalpy-correction, total free-energy correction etc. Always per reaction
