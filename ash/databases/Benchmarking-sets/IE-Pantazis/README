This is a benchmarking test set of ionization energies.
Combination of Isegawa-Pantazis testset and others.
XYZ-files from Isegawa are DFT-optimized with TPSS/def2-TZVP(-f)
TODO: Reoptimize everything with a consistent level of theory. wB97M-D3BJ/def2-TZVP ??

Reference data are inside file of test set. Uses updated reference data from Sterling, Bjornsson et al. See SI
Charge and multiplicities are in title line of each XYZ file
