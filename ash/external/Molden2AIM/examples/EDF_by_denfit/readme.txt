This example shows how to generate EDF for atomic core densities.

1. Do an atomic all-electron quantum chemistry calculation (HF/DFT/MCSCF), and generate a molden/fchk file.

2. Edit the molden/fchk file, and delete all the valence orbitals (or setup their Occup = 0).

3. Open the molden/fchk file using MultiWFN, and save radial density into a data file:

   3/1/2/
   0 0 0 0 0 5
   2

   3000 points will be generated by default. Increase num1Dpoints in settings.ini for more points and num1Dpoints
   > 10000 is suggested for better accuracy.

4. Do fitting by denfit. An input file should be prepared (Re68.dat in this example).

   denfit.exe < Re68.dat > results.txt
